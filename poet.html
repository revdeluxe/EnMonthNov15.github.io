		Isn't Frustrating? to do things<br>
		You don't normally do, A deep <br>
		Silence of solidarity that also<br>
		tend to break us.<br>
		<br> Apart from the silence<br>
		A epidemice swep the Land <br>
		thus having a plague that whom<br>
		Knows where it began.<br>
		<br> It's not just the plague<br>
		that is killing us. The economy<br>
		Itself is dying, if none of us<br>
		Make a move none will survive<br>
		<br> As the trades goes down and<br>
		So are the people. Two months have<br>
		Passed the plague continue to take<br>
		Lives as many of us suffers.<br>
		<br> It seems rather flawed to think<br>
		Of a income as everday meals<br>
		Are rationed and chromatically decreasing<br>
		as our mental health starts to decline<br>
		<br> Little by Little people gathered<br>
		Ideas to prevent this from happening<br>
		as this Post-state of pandemic none knows<br>
		what happens next...
